# Authenticate users on your chatbot with SMS one time passcode

Chatbots are prevalent everywhere. Some conversations are confidential and hence chatbots have to verify authenticity of users. Sending an OTP via SMS is a popular way to identify a user. 

In this code pattern we will provide steps to build a chatbot application that authenticates users through an SMS one time passcode (OTP). For example, a customer holding an insurance policy can use chatbot to get more information about his/her insurance policy. We will demonstrate
e the usage of Watson Assistant, Cloud Functions and Custom APIs to build this application.

When you have completed this code pattern, you will understand how to:

* Build conversational interfaces into any application, device, or channel.
* Run your application code without servers.
* Build APIs to authenticate users on your chatbot.
* Make external API calls through Watson Assistant.

## Flow


1. User registers for a policy on the portal.
2. User data is stored in the database and policy details are sent to user’s phone number in an SMS through Twilio Messaging API.
3. User interacts with chatbot and asks for confidential info related to the policy. The user is prompted to enter OTP by Watson Assistant.
4. The query is sent to Watson Assistant which in turn invokes Cloud function to make an API call to the user defined backend API for retrieving info.
5. The user’s phone number is searched in the database and OTP generated by backend API is sent to user through Twilio.
6. User enters the OTP, in the chat application to authenticate himself/herself.
7. Watson Assistant validates OTP by interacting with backend API.
8. If the OTP is valid, the user requested confidential info is fetched from the database.
8. Cloud function returns the confidential info to Watson Assistant.
10. Watson Assistant displays the user requested confidential info.
11. User can see the confidential info in the Web UI.

8. [Deploy and Run the Web Application](#8-deploy-and-run-the-web-application)

### 1. Clone the repo

Clone the `authenticate-users-on-your-chatbot-with-sms-otp` repo locally. In a terminal, run:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/IBM/authenticate-users-on-your-chatbot-with-sms-otp.git
```


### 2. Setup Twilio messaging service

Twilio is a SaaS offering that provides APIs to make and receive calls or text messages. We will be using Twilio to send SMS to user programmatically from backend. Lets start by creating a free Twilio service.

---

#### 2.1 Create Twilio service

- Create a free Twilio service here: <https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio>.

>NOTE: - Once you create a Twilio service, you will have to verify your email id as well as your phone number.

>- You will receive verification link in the email provided during Twilio sign up. Go ahead and verify your email id.
![](doc/source/images/verifyTwilio.png)

- Once email id is verified you will be prompted to enter your phone number, submit that and you will get an OTP on your registered number, enter that back to verify.

    ![](doc/source/images/verifyMobileTwilio.png)

- On successful verification you should see a welcome greeting message, additionally you will see some questions, select as described below.

    ![](doc/source/images/twilio-details.png)

    Questions|Answers
    --|--
    Which Twilio product are you here to use?| SMS
    What do you plan to build with Twilio?| Alerts & Notifications
    How do you want to build with Twilio?| With code
    What is your preferred coding language?| Python
    Would you like Twilio to host your code?| No, I want to use my own hosting service

---
#### 2.2 Create Twilio Trial Number

- You will need a Twilio `Trial Number` to send messages(OTP). Click on **Get a Trial Number** as shown.

    ![](doc/source/images/twilio-credentials-from-twilio-console.png)

- Click on **Choose this Number** to continue. 

    ![](doc/source/images/twilioNo.png)

- A confirmation will be displayed once the number is generated, click on **Done**.

    ![](doc/source/images/congrats.png)
---
#### 2.3 Verified Caller IDs

- Twilio trial number doesn't send messages to your phone number if your phone number is not added to the `Verified Caller IDs` list. This is a limitation of a free trial number. Visit <https://www.twilio.com/console/phone-numbers/verified> and add your phone number to the verified caller ID list before you continue.
---
- To establish connection between the APIs and Twilio we need to get the `trial_number`, `account_sid` and `auth_token` from Twilio. 

- Visit <https://www.twilio.com/console> and expand the **Project Info** tab. You will see the `TRIAL NUMBER`, `ACCOUNT SID` and `AUTH TOKEN`, copy it in some notepad as it will be used in [Step 3](#3-deploy-custom-apis).
![](doc/source/images/credentials-twilio.png)

- At this point, you should have the `TRIAL NUMBER`, `ACCOUNT SID` and `AUTH TOKEN` from Twilio service.

- Now lets deploy the custom APIs and configure twilio credentials.

### 3. Deploy Custom APIs

In this code pattern, custom APIs are developed to perform various tasks such as:
- Store users data in a Database
- Search users phone number and send out an OTP
- Validate OTP and Authenticate users
- Query users data

Custom APIs are developed in Python Flask and you can deploy it in OpenShift or IBM Cloud Foundry.

<details><summary><b>Steps to Build and Deploy on OpenShift</b></summary>

<b>Note:</b> If you want to deploy the Custom APIs without any modifications, you can skip the **Build** steps and directly follow the **Deploy** steps. If you want to make some modifications in the APIs and then deploy it then follow the **Build** step.
