/**
 * The IBM Watson&trade; Speech to Text service provides APIs that use IBM's speech-recognition capabilities to produce
 * transcripts of spoken audio. The service can transcribe speech from various languages and audio formats. In addition
 * to basic transcription, the service can produce detailed information about many different aspects of the audio. For
 * most languages, the service supports two sampling rates, broadband and narrowband. It returns all JSON response
 * content in the UTF-8 character set.
 *
 * For speech recognition, the service supports synchronous and asynchronous HTTP Representational State Transfer (REST)
 * interfaces. It also supports a WebSocket interface that provides a full-duplex, low-latency communication channel:
 * Clients send requests and audio to the service and receive results over a single connection asynchronously.
 *
 * The service also offers two customization interfaces. Use language model customization to expand the vocabulary of a
 * base model with domain-specific terminology. Use acoustic model customization to adapt a base model for the acoustic
 * characteristics of your audio. For language model customization, the service also supports grammars. A grammar is a
 * formal language specification that lets you restrict the phrases that the service can recognize.
 *
 * Language model customization and acoustic model customization are generally available for production use with all
 * language models that are generally available. Grammars are beta functionality for all language models that support
 * language model customization.

     * Recognize audio.
     *
     * Sends audio and returns transcription results for a recognition request. You can pass a maximum of 100 MB and a
     * minimum of 100 bytes of audio with a request. The service automatically detects the endianness of the incoming
     * audio and, for audio that includes multiple channels, downmixes the audio to one-channel mono during transcoding.
     * The method returns only final results; to enable interim results, use the WebSocket API. (With the `curl` command,
     * use the `--data-binary` option to upload the file for the request.)
     *
     * **See also:** [Making a basic HTTP
     * request](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-http#HTTP-basic).
     *
     * ### Streaming mode
     *
     *  For requests to transcribe live audio as it becomes available, you must set the `Transfer-Encoding` header to
     * `chunked` to use streaming mode. In streaming mode, the service closes the connection (status code 408) if it does
     * not receive at least 15 seconds of audio (including silence) in any 30-second period. The service also closes the
     * connection (status code 400) if it detects no speech for `inactivity_timeout` seconds of streaming audio; use the
     * `inactivity_timeout` parameter to change the default of 30 seconds.
     *
     * **See also:**
     * * [Audio transmission](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-input#transmission)
     * * [Timeouts](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-input#timeouts)
     *
     * ### Audio formats (content types)
     *
     *  The service accepts audio in the following formats (MIME types).
     * * For formats that are labeled **Required**, you must use the `Content-Type` header with the request to specify the
     * format of the audio.
     * * For all other formats, you can omit the `Content-Type` header or specify `application/octet-stream` with the
     * header to have the service automatically detect the format of the audio. (With the `curl` command, you can specify
     * either `"Content-Type:"` or `"Content-Type: application/octet-stream"`.)
     *
     * Where indicated, the format that you specify must include the sampling rate and can optionally include the number
     * of channels and the endianness of the audio.
     * * `audio/alaw` (**Required.** Specify the sampling rate (`rate`) of the audio.)
     * * `audio/basic` (**Required.** Use only with narrowband models.)
     * * `audio/flac`
     * * `audio/g729` (Use only with narrowband models.)
     * * `audio/l16` (**Required.** Specify the sampling rate (`rate`) and optionally the number of channels (`channels`)
     * and endianness (`endianness`) of the audio.)
     * * `audio/mp3`
     * * `audio/mpeg`
     * * `audio/mulaw` (**Required.** Specify the sampling rate (`rate`) of the audio.)
     * * `audio/ogg` (The service automatically detects the codec of the input audio.)
     * * `audio/ogg;codecs=opus`
     * * `audio/ogg;codecs=vorbis`
     * * `audio/wav` (Provide audio with a maximum of nine channels.)
     * * `audio/webm` (The service automatically detects the codec of the input audio.)
     * * `audio/webm;codecs=opus`
     * * `audio/webm;codecs=vorbis`
     *
     * The sampling rate of the audio must match the sampling rate of the model for the recognition request: for broadband
     * models, at least 16 kHz; for narrowband models, at least 8 kHz. If the sampling rate of the audio is higher than
     * the minimum required rate, the service down-samples the audio to the appropriate rate. If the sampling rate of the
     * audio is lower than the minimum required rate, the request fails.
     *
     *  **See also:** [Audio
     * formats](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-audio-formats#audio-formats).
     *
     * ### Multipart speech recognition
     *
     *  **Note:** The Watson SDKs do not support multipart speech recognition.
     *
     * The HTTP `POST` method of the service also supports multipart speech recognition. With multipart requests, you pass
     * all audio data as multipart form data. You specify some parameters as request headers and query parameters, but you
     * pass JSON metadata as form data to control most aspects of the transcription. You can use multipart recognition to
     * pass multiple audio files with a single request.
     *
     * Use the multipart approach with browsers for which JavaScript is disabled or when the parameters used with the
     * request are greater than the 8 KB limit imposed by most HTTP servers and proxies. You can encounter this limit, for
     * example, if you want to spot a very large number of keywords.
     *
     * **See also:** [Making a multipart HTTP
     * request](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-http#HTTP-multi).
     *
     * @param {Object} params - The parameters to send to the service.
     * @param {NodeJS.ReadableStream|Buffer} params.audio - The audio to transcribe.
     * @param {string} [params.contentType] - The format (MIME type) of the audio. For more information about specifying
     * an audio format, see **Audio formats (content types)** in the method description.
     * @param {string} [params.model] - The identifier of the model that is to be used for the recognition request.
     * (**Note:** The model `ar-AR_BroadbandModel` is deprecated; use `ar-MS_BroadbandModel` instead.) See [Languages and
     * models](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-models#models).
     * @param {string} [params.languageCustomizationId] - The customization ID (GUID) of a custom language model that is
     * to be used with the recognition request. The base model of the specified custom language model must match the model
     * specified with the `model` parameter. You must make the request with credentials for the instance of the service
     * that owns the custom model. By default, no custom language model is used. See [Custom
     * models](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-input#custom-input).
     *
     * **Note:** Use this parameter instead of the deprecated `customization_id` parameter.
     * @param {string} [params.acousticCustomizationId] - The customization ID (GUID) of a custom acoustic model that is
     * to be used with the recognition request. The base model of the specified custom acoustic model must match the model
     * specified with the `model` parameter. You must make the request with credentials for the instance of the service
     * that owns the custom model. By default, no custom acoustic model is used. See [Custom
     * models](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-input#custom-input).
     * @param {string} [params.baseModelVersion] - The version of the specified base model that is to be used with the
     * recognition request. Multiple versions of a base model can exist when a model is updated for internal improvements.
     * The parameter is intended primarily for use with custom models that have been upgraded for a new base model. The
     * default value depends on whether the parameter is used with or without a custom model. See [Base model
     * version](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-input#version).
     * @param {number} [params.customizationWeight] - If you specify the customization ID (GUID) of a custom language
     * model with the recognition request, the customization weight tells the service how much weight to give to words
     * from the custom language model compared to those from the base model for the current request.
     *
     * Specify a value between 0.0 and 1.0. Unless a different customization weight was specified for the custom model
     * when it was trained, the default value is 0.3. A customization weight that you specify overrides a weight that was
     * specified when the custom model was trained.
     *
     * The default value yields the best performance in general. Assign a higher value if your audio makes frequent use of
     * OOV words from the custom model. Use caution when setting the weight: a higher value can improve the accuracy of
     * phrases from the custom model's domain, but it can negatively affect performance on non-domain phrases.
     *
     * See [Custom models](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-input#custom-input).
     * @param {number} [params.inactivityTimeout] - The time in seconds after which, if only silence (no speech) is
     * detected in streaming audio, the connection is closed with a 400 error. The parameter is useful for stopping audio
     * submission from a live microphone when a user simply walks away. Use `-1` for infinity. See [Inactivity
     * timeout](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-input#timeouts-inactivity).
     * @param {string[]} [params.keywords] - An array of keyword strings to spot in the audio. Each keyword string can
     * include one or more string tokens. Keywords are spotted only in the final results, not in interim hypotheses. If
     * you specify any keywords, you must also specify a keywords threshold. Omit the parameter or specify an empty array
     * if you do not need to spot keywords.
     *
     * You can spot a maximum of 1000 keywords with a single request. A single keyword can have a maximum length of 1024
     * characters, though the maximum effective length for double-byte languages might be shorter. Keywords are
     * case-insensitive.
     *
     * See [Keyword spotting](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-output#keyword_spotting).
     * @param {number} [params.keywordsThreshold] - A confidence value that is the lower bound for spotting a keyword. A
     * word is considered to match a keyword if its confidence is greater than or equal to the threshold. Specify a
     * probability between 0.0 and 1.0. If you specify a threshold, you must also specify one or more keywords. The
     * service performs no keyword spotting if you omit either parameter. See [Keyword
     * spotting](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-output#keyword_spotting).
     * @param {number} [params.maxAlternatives] - The maximum number of alternative transcripts that the service is to
     * return. By default, the service returns a single transcript. If you specify a value of `0`, the service uses the
     * default value, `1`. See [Maximum
     * alternatives](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-output#max_alternatives).
     * @param {number} [params.wordAlternativesThreshold] - A confidence value that is the lower bound for identifying a
     * hypothesis as a possible word alternative (also known as "Confusion Networks"). An alternative word is considered
     * if its confidence is greater than or equal to the threshold. Specify a probability between 0.0 and 1.0. By default,
     * the service computes no alternative words. See [Word
     * alternatives](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-output#word_alternatives).
     * @param {boolean} [params.wordConfidence] - If `true`, the service returns a confidence measure in the range of 0.0
     * to 1.0 for each word. By default, the service returns no word confidence scores. See [Word
     * confidence](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-output#word_confidence).
     * @param {boolean} [params.timestamps] - If `true`, the service returns time alignment for each word. By default, no
     * timestamps are returned. See [Word
     * timestamps](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-output#word_timestamps).
     * @param {boolean} [params.profanityFilter] - If `true`, the service filters profanity from all output except for
     * keyword results by replacing inappropriate words with a series of asterisks. Set the parameter to `false` to return
     * results with no censoring. Applies to US English transcription only. See [Profanity
     * filtering](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-output#profanity_filter).
     * @param {boolean} [params.smartFormatting] - If `true`, the service converts dates, times, series of digits and
     * numbers, phone numbers, currency values, and internet addresses into more readable, conventional representations in
     * the final transcript of a recognition request. For US English, the service also converts certain keyword strings to
     * punctuation symbols. By default, the service performs no smart formatting.
     *
     * **Note:** Applies to US English, Japanese, and Spanish transcription only.
     *
     * See [Smart formatting](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-output#smart_formatting).
     * @param {boolean} [params.speakerLabels] - If `true`, the response includes labels that identify which words were
     * spoken by which participants in a multi-person exchange. By default, the service returns no speaker labels. Setting
     * `speaker_labels` to `true` forces the `timestamps` parameter to be `true`, regardless of whether you specify
     * `false` for the parameter.
     *
     * **Note:** Applies to US English, Australian English, German, Japanese, Korean, and Spanish (both broadband and
     * narrowband models) and UK English (narrowband model) transcription only.
     *
     * See [Speaker labels](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-output#speaker_labels).
     * @param {string} [params.customizationId] - **Deprecated.** Use the `language_customization_id` parameter to specify
     * the customization ID (GUID) of a custom language model that is to be used with the recognition request. Do not
     * specify both parameters with a request.
     * @param {string} [params.grammarName] - The name of a grammar that is to be used with the recognition request. If
     * you specify a grammar, you must also use the `language_customization_id` parameter to specify the name of the
     * custom language model for which the grammar is defined. The service recognizes only strings that are recognized by
     * the specified grammar; it does not recognize other custom words from the model's words resource. See
     * [Grammars](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-input#grammars-input).
     * @param {boolean} [params.redaction] - If `true`, the service redacts, or masks, numeric data from final
     * transcripts. The feature redacts any number that has three or more consecutive digits by replacing each digit with
     * an `X` character. It is intended to redact sensitive numeric data, such as credit card numbers. By default, the
     * service performs no redaction.
     *
     * When you enable redaction, the service automatically enables smart formatting, regardless of whether you explicitly
     * disable that feature. To ensure maximum security, the service also disables keyword spotting (ignores the
     * `keywords` and `keywords_threshold` parameters) and returns only a single final transcript (forces the
     * `max_alternatives` parameter to be `1`).
     *
     * **Note:** Applies to US English, Japanese, and Korean transcription only.
     *
     * See [Numeric redaction](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-output#redaction).
     * @param {boolean} [params.audioMetrics] - If `true`, requests detailed information about the signal characteristics
     * of the input audio. The service returns audio metrics with the final transcription results. By default, the service
     * returns no audio metrics.
     *
     * See [Audio metrics](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-metrics#audio_metrics).
     * @param {number} [params.endOfPhraseSilenceTime] - If `true`, specifies the duration of the pause interval at which
     * the service splits a transcript into multiple final results. If the service detects pauses or extended silence
     * before it reaches the end of the audio stream, its response can include multiple final results. Silence indicates a
     * point at which the speaker pauses between spoken words or phrases.
     *
     * Specify a value for the pause interval in the range of 0.0 to 120.0.
     * * A value greater than 0 specifies the interval that the service is to use for speech recognition.
     * * A value of 0 indicates that the service is to use the default interval. It is equivalent to omitting the
     * parameter.
     *
     * The default pause interval for most languages is 0.8 seconds; the default for Chinese is 0.6 seconds.
     *
     * See [End of phrase silence
     * time](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-output#silence_time).
     * @param {boolean} [params.splitTranscriptAtPhraseEnd] - If `true`, directs the service to split the transcript into
     * multiple final results based on semantic features of the input, for example, at the conclusion of meaningful
     * phrases such as sentences. The service bases its understanding of semantic features on the base language model that
     * you use with a request. Custom language models and grammars can also influence how and where the service splits a
     * transcript. By default, the service splits transcripts based solely on the pause interval.
     *
     * See [Split transcript at phrase
     * end](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-output#split_transcript).
     * @param {number} [params.speechDetectorSensitivity] - The sensitivity of speech activity detection that the service
     * is to perform. Use the parameter to suppress word insertions from music, coughing, and other non-speech events. The
     * service biases the audio it passes for speech recognition by evaluating the input audio against prior models of
     * speech and non-speech activity.
     *
     * Specify a value between 0.0 and 1.0:
     * * 0.0 suppresses all audio (no speech is transcribed).
     * * 0.5 (the default) provides a reasonable compromise for the level of sensitivity.
     * * 1.0 suppresses no audio (speech detection sensitivity is disabled).
     *
     * The values increase on a monotonic curve. See [Speech Activity
     * Detection](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-input#detection).
     * @param {number} [params.backgroundAudioSuppression] - The level to which the service is to suppress background
     * audio based on its volume to prevent it from being transcribed as speech. Use the parameter to suppress side
     * conversations or background noise.
     *
     * Specify a value in the range of 0.0 to 1.0:
     * * 0.0 (the default) provides no suppression (background audio suppression is disabled).
     * * 0.5 provides a reasonable level of audio suppression for general usage.
     * * 1.0 suppresses all audio (no audio is transcribed).
     *
     * The values increase on a monotonic curve. See [Speech Activity
     * Detection](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-input#detection).

     *
     * Registers a callback URL with the service for use with subsequent asynchronous recognition requests. The service
     * attempts to register, or allowlist, the callback URL if it is not already registered by sending a `GET` request to
     * the callback URL. The service passes a random alphanumeric challenge string via the `challenge_string` parameter of
     * the request. The request includes an `Accept` header that specifies `text/plain` as the required response type.
     *
     * To be registered successfully, the callback URL must respond to the `GET` request from the service. The response
     * must send status code 200 and must include the challenge string in its body. Set the `Content-Type` response header
     * to `text/plain`. Upon receiving this response, the service responds to the original registration request with

     *
     * The service sends only a single `GET` request to the callback URL. If the service does not receive a reply with a

     *
     * If you specify a user secret with the request, the service uses it as a key to calculate an HMAC-SHA1 signature of

    /**
     * Create a job.
     *
     * Creates a job for a new asynchronous recognition request. The job is owned by the instance of the service whose
     * credentials are used to create it. How you learn the status and results of a job depends on the parameters you
     * include with the job creation request:
     * * By callback notification: Include the `callback_url` parameter to specify a URL to which the service is to send
     * callback notifications when the status of the job changes. Optionally, you can also include the `events` and
     * `user_token` parameters to subscribe to specific events and to specify a string that is to be included with each
     * notification for the job.
     * * By polling the service: Omit the `callback_url`, `events`, and `user_token` parameters. You must then use the
     * **Check jobs** or **Check a job** methods to check the status of the job, using the latter to retrieve the results
     * when the job is complete.
     *
     * The two approaches are not mutually exclusive. You can poll the service for job status or obtain results from the
     * service manually even if you include a callback URL. In both cases, you can include the `results_ttl` parameter to
     * specify how long the results are to remain available after the job is complete. Using the HTTPS **Check a job**
     * method to retrieve results is more secure than receiving them via callback notification over HTTP because it
     * provides confidentiality in addition to authentication and data integrity.
     *
     * The method supports the same basic parameters as other HTTP and WebSocket recognition requests. It also supports
     * the following parameters specific to the asynchronous interface:
     * * `callback_url`
     * * `events`
     * * `user_token`
     * * `results_ttl`
     *
     * You can pass a maximum of 1 GB and a minimum of 100 bytes of audio with a request. The service automatically
     * detects the endianness of the incoming audio and, for audio that includes multiple channels, downmixes the audio to
     * one-channel mono during transcoding. The method returns only final results; to enable interim results, use the
     * WebSocket API. (With the `curl` command, use the `--data-binary` option to upload the file for the request.)
     *
     * **See also:** [Creating a job](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-async#create).
     *
     * ### Streaming mode
     *
     *  For requests to transcribe live audio as it becomes available, you must set the `Transfer-Encoding` header to
     * `chunked` to use streaming mode. In streaming mode, the service closes the connection (status code 408) if it does
     * not receive at least 15 seconds of audio (including silence) in any 30-second period. The service also closes the
     * connection (status code 400) if it detects no speech for `inactivity_timeout` seconds of streaming audio; use the
     * `inactivity_timeout` parameter to change the default of 30 seconds.
     *
     * **See also:**
     * * [Audio transmission](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-input#transmission)
     * * [Timeouts](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-input#timeouts)
     *
     * ### Audio formats (content types)
     *
     *  The service accepts audio in the following formats (MIME types).
     * * For formats that are labeled **Required**, you must use the `Content-Type` header with the request to specify the
     * format of the audio.
     * * For all other formats, you can omit the `Content-Type` header or specify `application/octet-stream` with the
     * header to have the service automatically detect the format of the audio. (With the `curl` command, you can specify
     * either `"Content-Type:"` or `"Content-Type: application/octet-stream"`.)
     *
     * Where indicated, the format that you specify must include the sampling rate and can optionally include the number
     * of channels and the endianness of the audio.
     * * `audio/alaw` (**Required.** Specify the sampling rate (`rate`) of the audio.)
     * * `audio/basic` (**Required.** Use only with narrowband models.)
     * * `audio/flac`
     * * `audio/g729` (Use only with narrowband models.)
     * * `audio/l16` (**Required.** Specify the sampling rate (`rate`) and optionally the number of channels (`channels`)
     * and endianness (`endianness`) of the audio.)
     * * `audio/mp3`
     * * `audio/mpeg`
     * * `audio/mulaw` (**Required.** Specify the sampling rate (`rate`) of the audio.)
     * * `audio/ogg` (The service automatically detects the codec of the input audio.)
     * * `audio/ogg;codecs=opus`
     * * `audio/ogg;codecs=vorbis`
     * * `audio/wav` (Provide audio with a maximum of nine channels.)
     * * `audio/webm` (The service automatically detects the codec of the input audio.)
     * * `audio/webm;codecs=opus`
     * * `audio/webm;codecs=vorbis`
     *
     * The sampling rate of the audio must match the sampling rate of the model for the recognition request: for broadband
     * models, at least 16 kHz; for narrowband models, at least 8 kHz. If the sampling rate of the audio is higher than
     * the minimum required rate, the service down-samples the audio to the appropriate rate. If the sampling rate of the
     * audio is lower than the minimum required rate, the request fails.
     *
     *  **See also:** [Audio
     * formats](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-audio-formats#audio-formats).
     *
     * @param {Object} params - The parameters to send to the service.
     * @param {NodeJS.ReadableStream|Buffer} params.audio - The audio to transcribe.
     * @param {string} [params.contentType] - The format (MIME type) of the audio. For more information about specifying
     * an audio format, see **Audio formats (content types)** in the method description.
     * @param {string} [params.model] - The identifier of the model that is to be used for the recognition request.
     * (**Note:** The model `ar-AR_BroadbandModel` is deprecated; use `ar-MS_BroadbandModel` instead.) See [Languages and
     * models](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-models#models).
     * @param {string} [params.callbackUrl] - A URL to which callback notifications are to be sent. The URL must already
     * be successfully allowlisted by using the **Register a callback** method. You can include the same callback URL with
     * any number of job creation requests. Omit the parameter to poll the service for job completion and results.
     *
     * Use the `user_token` parameter to specify a unique user-specified string with each job to differentiate the
     * callback notifications for the jobs.
     * @param {string} [params.events] - If the job includes a callback URL, a comma-separated list of notification events
     * to which to subscribe. Valid events are
     * * `recognitions.started` generates a callback notification when the service begins to process the job.
     * * `recognitions.completed` generates a callback notification when the job is complete. You must use the **Check a
     * job** method to retrieve the results before they time out or are deleted.
     * * `recognitions.completed_with_results` generates a callback notification when the job is complete. The
     * notification includes the results of the request.
     * * `recognitions.failed` generates a callback notification if the service experiences an error while processing the
     * job.
     *
     * The `recognitions.completed` and `recognitions.completed_with_results` events are incompatible. You can specify
     * only of the two events.
     *
     * If the job includes a callback URL, omit the parameter to subscribe to the default events: `recognitions.started`,
     * `recognitions.completed`, and `recognitions.failed`. If the job does not include a callback URL, omit the
     * parameter.
     * @param {string} [params.userToken] - If the job includes a callback URL, a user-specified string that the service
     * is to include with each callback notification for the job; the token allows the user to maintain an internal
     * mapping between jobs and notification events. If the job does not include a callback URL, omit the parameter.
     * @param {number} [params.resultsTtl] - The number of minutes for which the results are to be available after the job
     * has finished. If not delivered via a callback, the results must be retrieved within this time. Omit the parameter
     * to use a time to live of one week. The parameter is valid with or without a callback URL.
     * @param {string} [params.languageCustomizationId] - The customization ID (GUID) of a custom language model that is
     * to be used with the recognition request. The base model of the specified custom language model must match the model
     * specified with the `model` parameter. You must make the request with credentials for the instance of the service
     * that owns the custom model. By default, no custom language model is used. See [Custom
     * models](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-input#custom-input).
     *
     * **Note:** Use this parameter instead of the deprecated `customization_id` parameter.
     * @param {string} [params.acousticCustomizationId] - The customization ID (GUID) of a custom acoustic model that is
     * to be used with the recognition request. The base model of the specified custom acoustic model must match the model
     * specified with the `model` parameter. You must make the request with credentials for the instance of the service
     * that owns the custom model. By default, no custom acoustic model is used. See [Custom
     * models](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-input#custom-input).
     * @param {string} [params.baseModelVersion] - The version of the specified base model that is to be used with the
     * recognition request. Multiple versions of a base model can exist when a model is updated for internal improvements.
     * The parameter is intended primarily for use with custom models that have been upgraded for a new base model. The
     * default value depends on whether the parameter is used with or without a custom model. See [Base model
     * version](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-input#version).
     * @param {number} [params.customizationWeight] - If you specify the customization ID (GUID) of a custom language
     * model with the recognition request, the customization weight tells the service how much weight to give to words
     * from the custom language model compared to those from the base model for the current request.
     *
     * Specify a value between 0.0 and 1.0. Unless a different customization weight was specified for the custom model
     * when it was trained, the default value is 0.3. A customization weight that you specify overrides a weight that was
     * specified when the custom model was trained.
     *
     * The default value yields the best performance in general. Assign a higher value if your audio makes frequent use of
     * OOV words from the custom model. Use caution when setting the weight: a higher value can improve the accuracy of
     * phrases from the custom model's domain, but it can negatively affect performance on non-domain phrases.
     *
     * See [Custom models](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-input#custom-input).
     * @param {number} [params.inactivityTimeout] - The time in seconds after which, if only silence (no speech) is
     * detected in streaming audio, the connection is closed with a 400 error. The parameter is useful for stopping audio
     * submission from a live microphone when a user simply walks away. Use `-1` for infinity. See [Inactivity
     * timeout](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-input#timeouts-inactivity).
     * @param {string[]} [params.keywords] - An array of keyword strings to spot in the audio. Each keyword string can
     * include one or more string tokens. Keywords are spotted only in the final results, not in interim hypotheses. If
     * you specify any keywords, you must also specify a keywords threshold. Omit the parameter or specify an empty array
     * if you do not need to spot keywords.
     *
     * You can spot a maximum of 1000 keywords with a single request. A single keyword can have a maximum length of 1024
     * characters, though the maximum effective length for double-byte languages might be shorter. Keywords are
     * case-insensitive.
     *
     * See [Keyword spotting](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-output#keyword_spotting).
     * @param {number} [params.keywordsThreshold] - A confidence value that is the lower bound for spotting a keyword. A
     * word is considered to match a keyword if its confidence is greater than or equal to the threshold. Specify a
     * probability between 0.0 and 1.0. If you specify a threshold, you must also specify one or more keywords. The
     * service performs no keyword spotting if you omit either parameter. See [Keyword
     * spotting](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-output#keyword_spotting).
     * @param {number} [params.maxAlternatives] - The maximum number of alternative transcripts that the service is to
     * return. By default, the service returns a single transcript. If you specify a value of `0`, the service uses the
     * default value, `1`. See [Maximum
     * alternatives](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-output#max_alternatives).
     * @param {number} [params.wordAlternativesThreshold] - A confidence value that is the lower bound for identifying a
     * hypothesis as a possible word alternative (also known as "Confusion Networks"). An alternative word is considered
     * if its confidence is greater than or equal to the threshold. Specify a probability between 0.0 and 1.0. By default,
     * the service computes no alternative words. See [Word
     * alternatives](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-output#word_alternatives).
     * @param {boolean} [params.wordConfidence] - If `true`, the service returns a confidence measure in the range of 0.0
     * to 1.0 for each word. By default, the service returns no word confidence scores. See [Word
     * confidence](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-output#word_confidence).
     * @param {boolean} [params.timestamps] - If `true`, the service returns time alignment for each word. By default, no
     * timestamps are returned. See [Word
     * timestamps](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-output#word_timestamps).
     * @param {boolean} [params.profanityFilter] - If `true`, the service filters profanity from all output except for
     * keyword results by replacing inappropriate words with a series of asterisks. Set the parameter to `false` to return
     * results with no censoring. Applies to US English transcription only. See [Profanity
     * filtering](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-output#profanity_filter).
     * @param {boolean} [params.smartFormatting] - If `true`, the service converts dates, times, series of digits and
     * numbers, phone numbers, currency values, and internet addresses into more readable, conventional representations in
     * the final transcript of a recognition request. For US English, the service also converts certain keyword strings to
     * punctuation symbols. By default, the service performs no smart formatting.
     *
     * **Note:** Applies to US English, Japanese, and Spanish transcription only.
     *
     * See [Smart formatting](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-output#smart_formatting).
     * @param {boolean} [params.speakerLabels] - If `true`, the response includes labels that identify which words were
     * spoken by which participants in a multi-person exchange. By default, the service returns no speaker labels. Setting
     * `speaker_labels` to `true` forces the `timestamps` parameter to be `true`, regardless of whether you specify
     * `false` for the parameter.
     *
     * **Note:** Applies to US English, Australian English, German, Japanese, Korean, and Spanish (both broadband and
     * narrowband models) and UK English (narrowband model) transcription only.
     *
     * See [Speaker labels](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-output#speaker_labels).
     * @param {string} [params.customizationId] - **Deprecated.** Use the `language_customization_id` parameter to specify
     * the customization ID (GUID) of a custom language model that is to be used with the recognition request. Do not
     * specify both parameters with a request.
     * @param {string} [params.grammarName] - The name of a grammar that is to be used with the recognition request. If
     * you specify a grammar, you must also use the `language_customization_id` parameter to specify the name of the
     * custom language model for which the grammar is defined. The service recognizes only strings that are recognized by
     * the specified grammar; it does not recognize other custom words from the model's words resource. See
     * [Grammars](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-input#grammars-input).
     * @param {boolean} [params.redaction] - If `true`, the service redacts, or masks, numeric data from final
     * transcripts. The feature redacts any number that has three or more consecutive digits by replacing each digit with
     * an `X` character. It is intended to redact sensitive numeric data, such as credit card numbers. By default, the
     * service performs no redaction.
     *
     * When you enable redaction, the service automatically enables smart formatting, regardless of whether you explicitly
     * disable that feature. To ensure maximum security, the service also disables keyword spotting (ignores the
     * `keywords` and `keywords_threshold` parameters) and returns only a single final transcript (forces the
     * `max_alternatives` parameter to be `1`).
     *
     * **Note:** Applies to US English, Japanese, and Korean transcription only.
     *
     * See [Numeric redaction](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-output#redaction).
     * @param {boolean} [params.processingMetrics] - If `true`, requests processing metrics about the service's
     * transcription of the input audio. The service returns processing metrics at the interval specified by the
     * `processing_metrics_interval` parameter. It also returns processing metrics for transcription events, for example,
     * for final and interim results. By default, the service returns no processing metrics.
     *
     * See [Processing
     * metrics](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-metrics#processing_metrics).
     * @param {number} [params.processingMetricsInterval] - Specifies the interval in real wall-clock seconds at which the
     * service is to return processing metrics. The parameter is ignored unless the `processing_metrics` parameter is set
     * to `true`.
     *
     * The parameter accepts a minimum value of 0.1 seconds. The level of precision is not restricted, so you can specify
     * values such as 0.25 and 0.125.
     *
     * The service does not impose a maximum value. If you want to receive processing metrics only for transcription
     * events instead of at periodic intervals, set the value to a large number. If the value is larger than the duration
     * of the audio, the service returns processing metrics only for transcription events.
     *
     * See [Processing
     * metrics](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-metrics#processing_metrics).
     * @param {boolean} [params.audioMetrics] - If `true`, requests detailed information about the signal characteristics
     * of the input audio. The service returns audio metrics with the final transcription results. By default, the service
     * returns no audio metrics.
     *
     * See [Audio metrics](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-metrics#audio_metrics).
     * @param {number} [params.endOfPhraseSilenceTime] - If `true`, specifies the duration of the pause interval at which
     * the service splits a transcript into multiple final results. If the service detects pauses or extended silence
     * before it reaches the end of the audio stream, its response can include multiple final results. Silence indicates a
     * point at which the speaker pauses between spoken words or phrases.
     *
     * Specify a value for the pause interval in the range of 0.0 to 120.0.
     * * A value greater than 0 specifies the interval that the service is to use for speech recognition.
     * * A value of 0 indicates that the service is to use the default interval. It is equivalent to omitting the
     * parameter.
     *
     * The default pause interval for most languages is 0.8 seconds; the default for Chinese is 0.6 seconds.
     *
     * See [End of phrase silence
     * time](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-output#silence_time).
     * @param {boolean} [params.splitTranscriptAtPhraseEnd] - If `true`, directs the service to split the transcript into
     * multiple final results based on semantic features of the input, for example, at the conclusion of meaningful
     * phrases such as sentences. The service bases its understanding of semantic features on the base language model that
     * you use with a request. Custom language models and grammars can also influence how and where the service splits a
     * transcript. By default, the service splits transcripts based solely on the pause interval.
     *
     * See [Split transcript at phrase
     * end](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-output#split_transcript).
     * @param {number} [params.speechDetectorSensitivity] - The sensitivity of speech activity detection that the service
     * is to perform. Use the parameter to suppress word insertions from music, coughing, and other non-speech events. The
     * service biases the audio it passes for speech recognition by evaluating the input audio against prior models of
     * speech and non-speech activity.
     *
     * Specify a value between 0.0 and 1.0:
     * * 0.0 suppresses all audio (no speech is transcribed).
     * * 0.5 (the default) provides a reasonable compromise for the level of sensitivity.
     * * 1.0 suppresses no audio (speech detection sensitivity is disabled).
     *
     * The values increase on a monotonic curve. See [Speech Activity
     * Detection](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-input#detection).
     * @param {number} [params.backgroundAudioSuppression] - The level to which the service is to suppress background
     * audio based on its volume to prevent it from being transcribed as speech. Use the parameter to suppress side
     * conversations or background noise.
     *
     * Specify a value in the range of 0.0 to 1.0:
     * * 0.0 (the default) provides no suppression (background audio suppression is disabled).
     * * 0.5 provides a reasonable level of audio suppression for general usage.
     * * 1.0 suppresses all audio (no audio is transcribed).
     *
     * The values increase on a monotonic curve. See [Speech Activity

     * @param {string} [params.wordTypeToAdd] - The type of words from the custom language model's words resource on which
     * to train the model:
     * * `all` (the default) trains the model on all new words, regardless of whether they were extracted from corpora or
     * grammars or were added or modified by the user.
     * * `user` trains the model only on new words that were added or modified by the user directly. The model is not
     * trained on new words extracted from corpora or grammars.
     * @param {number} [params.customizationWeight] - Specifies a customization weight for the custom language model. The
     * customization weight tells the service how much weight to give to words from the custom language model compared to
     * those from the base model for speech recognition. Specify a value between 0.0 and 1.0; the default is 0.3.
     *
     * The default value yields the best performance in general. Assign a higher value if your audio makes frequent use of
     * OOV words from the custom model. Use caution when setting the weight: a higher value can improve the accuracy of
     * phrases from the custom model's domain, but it can negatively affect performance on non-domain phrases.
     *
     * The value that you assign is used for all recognition requests that use the model. You can override it for any
     * recognition request by specifying a customization weight for that request.

     * Add custom words.
     *
     * Adds one or more custom words to a custom language model. The service populates the words resource for a custom
     * model with out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words from each corpus or grammar that is added to the model. You can use this
     * method to add additional words or to modify existing words in the words resource. The words resource for a model
     * can contain a maximum of 90 thousand custom (OOV) words. This includes words that the service extracts from corpora
     * and grammars and words that you add directly.
     *
     * You must use credentials for the instance of the service that owns a model to add or modify custom words for the
     * model. Adding or modifying custom words does not affect the custom model until you train the model for the new data
     * by using the **Train a custom language model** method.
     *
     * You add custom words by providing a `CustomWords` object, which is an array of `CustomWord` objects, one per word.
     * You must use the object's `word` parameter to identify the word that is to be added. You can also provide one or
     * both of the optional `sounds_like` and `display_as` fields for each word.
     * * The `sounds_like` field provides an array of one or more pronunciations for the word. Use the parameter to
     * specify how the word can be pronounced by users. Use the parameter for words that are difficult to pronounce,
     * foreign words, acronyms, and so on. For example, you might specify that the word `IEEE` can sound like `i triple
     * e`. You can specify a maximum of five sounds-like pronunciations for a word. If you omit the `sounds_like` field,
     * the service attempts to set the field to its pronunciation of the word. It cannot generate a pronunciation for all
     * words, so you must review the word's definition to ensure that it is complete and valid.
     * * The `display_as` field provides a different way of spelling the word in a transcript. Use the parameter when you
     * want the word to appear different from its usual representation or from its spelling in training data. For example,
     * you might indicate that the word `IBM(trademark)` is to be displayed as `IBM&trade;`.
     *
     * If you add a custom word that already exists in the words resource for the custom model, the new definition
     * overwrites the existing data for the word. If the service encounters an error with the input data, it returns a
     * failure code and does not add any of the words to the words resource.
     *
     * The call returns an HTTP 201 response code if the input data is valid. It then asynchronously processes the words
     * to add them to the model's words resource. The time that it takes for the analysis to complete depends on the
     * number of new words that you add but is generally faster than adding a corpus or grammar.
     *
     * You can monitor the status of the request by using the **List a custom language model** method to poll the model's
     * status. Use a loop to check the status every 10 seconds. The method returns a `Customization` object that includes
     * a `status` field. A status of `ready` means that the words have been added to the custom model. The service cannot
     * accept requests to add new data or to train the model until the existing request completes.
     *
     * You can use the **List custom words** or **List a custom word** method to review the words that you add. Words with
     * an invalid `sounds_like` field include an `error` field that describes the problem. You can use other words-related
     * methods to correct errors, eliminate typos, and modify how words are pronounced as needed.

     * models must be based on the same version of the same base model.
     * * The custom model contains one or more invalid audio resources. You can correct the invalid audio resources or set
     * the `strict` parameter to `false` to exclude the invalid resources from the training. The model must contain at

     * Add an audio resource.
     *
     * Adds an audio resource to a custom acoustic model. Add audio content that reflects the acoustic characteristics of
     * the audio that you plan to transcribe. You must use credentials for the instance of the service that owns a model
     * to add an audio resource to it. Adding audio data does not affect the custom acoustic model until you train the
     * model for the new data by using the **Train a custom acoustic model** method.
     *
     * You can add individual audio files or an archive file that contains multiple audio files. Adding multiple audio
     * files via a single archive file is significantly more efficient than adding each file individually. You can add
     * audio resources in any format that the service supports for speech recognition.
     *
     * You can use this method to add any number of audio resources to a custom model by calling the method once for each
     * audio or archive file. You can add multiple different audio resources at the same time. You must add a minimum of
     * 10 minutes and a maximum of 200 hours of audio that includes speech, not just silence, to a custom acoustic model

     * resource that has the same name as an existing audio resource, set the `allow_overwrite` parameter to `true`;
     * otherwise, the request fails.
     *
     * The method is asynchronous. It can take several seconds or minutes to complete depending on the duration of the
     * audio and, in the case of an archive file, the total number of audio files being processed. The service returns a
     * 201 response code if the audio is valid. It then asynchronously analyzes the contents of the audio file or files

     * submit requests to train or upgrade the model until the service's analysis of all audio resources for current
     * requests completes.
     *
     * To determine the status of the service's analysis of the audio, use the **Get an audio resource** method to poll
     * the status of the audio. The method accepts the customization ID of the custom model and the name of the audio
     * resource, and it returns the status of the resource. Use a loop to check the status of the audio every few seconds

     *
     * ### Content types for audio-type resources
     *
     *  You can add an individual audio file in any format that the service supports for speech recognition. For an
     * audio-type resource, use the `Content-Type` parameter to specify the audio format (MIME type) of the audio file,
     * including specifying the sampling rate, channels, and endianness where indicated.
     * * `audio/alaw` (Specify the sampling rate (`rate`) of the audio.)
     * * `audio/basic` (Use only with narrowband models.)
     * * `audio/flac`
     * * `audio/g729` (Use only with narrowband models.)
     * * `audio/l16` (Specify the sampling rate (`rate`) and optionally the number of channels (`channels`) and endianness
     * (`endianness`) of the audio.)
     * * `audio/mp3`
     * * `audio/mpeg`
     * * `audio/mulaw` (Specify the sampling rate (`rate`) of the audio.)
     * * `audio/ogg` (The service automatically detects the codec of the input audio.)
     * * `audio/ogg;codecs=opus`
     * * `audio/ogg;codecs=vorbis`
     * * `audio/wav` (Provide audio with a maximum of nine channels.)
     * * `audio/webm` (The service automatically detects the codec of the input audio.)
     * * `audio/webm;codecs=opus`
     * * `audio/webm;codecs=vorbis`
     *
     * The sampling rate of an audio file must match the sampling rate of the base model for the custom model: for
     * broadband models, at least 16 kHz; for narrowband models, at least 8 kHz. If the sampling rate of the audio is
     * higher than the minimum required rate, the service down-samples the audio to the appropriate rate. If the sampling
     * rate of the audio is lower than the minimum required rate, the service labels the audio file as `invalid`.
     *
     *  **See also:** [Audio
     * formats](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-audio-formats#audio-formats).
     *
     * ### Content types for archive-type resources
     *
     *  You can add an archive file (**.zip** or **.tar.gz** file) that contains audio files in any format that the
     * service supports for speech recognition. For an archive-type resource, use the `Content-Type` parameter to specify
     * the media type of the archive file:
     * * `application/zip` for a **.zip** file
     * * `application/gzip` for a **.tar.gz** file.
     *
     * When you add an archive-type resource, the `Contained-Content-Type` header is optional depending on the format of
     * the files that you are adding:
     * * For audio files of type `audio/alaw`, `audio/basic`, `audio/l16`, or `audio/mulaw`, you must use the
     * `Contained-Content-Type` header to specify the format of the contained audio files. Include the `rate`, `channels`,
     * and `endianness` parameters where necessary. In this case, all audio files contained in the archive file must have
     * the same audio format.
     * * For audio files of all other types, you can omit the `Contained-Content-Type` header. In this case, the audio
     * files contained in the archive file can have any of the formats not listed in the previous bullet. The audio files
     * do not need to have the same format.
     *
     * Do not use the `Contained-Content-Type` header when adding an audio-type resource.
     *
     * ### Naming restrictions for embedded audio files
     *
     *  The name of an audio file that is contained in an archive-type resource can include a maximum of 128 characters.
     * This includes the file extension and all elements of the name (for example, slashes).
     *
     * @param {Object} params - The parameters to send to the service.
     * @param {string} params.customizationId - The customization ID (GUID) of the custom acoustic model that is to be
     * used for the request. You must make the request with credentials for the instance of the service that owns the
     * custom model.
     * @param {string} params.audioName - The name of the new audio resource for the custom acoustic model. Use a
     * localized name that matches the language of the custom model and reflects the contents of the resource.
     * * Include a maximum of 128 characters in the name.
     * * Do not use characters that need to be URL-encoded. For example, do not use spaces, slashes, backslashes, colons,
     * ampersands, double quotes, plus signs, equals signs, questions marks, and so on in the name. (The service does not
     * prevent the use of these characters. But because they must be URL-encoded wherever used, their use is strongly
     * discouraged.)
     * * Do not use the name of an audio resource that has already been added to the custom model.
     * @param {NodeJS.ReadableStream|Buffer} params.audioResource - The audio resource that is to be added to the custom
     * acoustic model, an individual audio file or an archive file.
     *
     * With the `curl` command, use the `--data-binary` option to upload the file for the request.
     * @param {string} [params.contentType] - For an audio-type resource, the format (MIME type) of the audio. For more
     * information, see **Content types for audio-type resources** in the method description.
     *
     * For an archive-type resource, the media type of the archive file. For more information, see **Content types for
     * archive-type resources** in the method description.
     * @param {string} [params.containedContentType] - **For an archive-type resource,** specify the format of the audio
     * files that are contained in the archive file if they are of type `audio/alaw`, `audio/basic`, `audio/l16`, or
     * `audio/mulaw`. Include the `rate`, `channels`, and `endianness` parameters where necessary. In this case, all audio
     * files that are contained in the archive file must be of the indicated type.
     *
     * For all other audio formats, you can omit the header. In this case, the audio files can be of multiple types as
     * long as they are not of the types listed in the previous paragraph.
     *
     * The parameter accepts all of the audio formats that are supported for use with speech recognition. For more
     * information, see **Content types for audio-type resources** in the method description.
     *
     * **For an audio-type resource,** omit the header.
     * @param {boolean} [params.allowOverwrite] - If `true`, the specified audio resource overwrites an existing audio
     * resource with the same name. If `false`, the request fails if an audio resource with the same name already exists.
