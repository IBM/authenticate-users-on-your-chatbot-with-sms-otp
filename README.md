# Authenticate users on your chatbot with SMS one time passcode

Chatbots are prevalent everywhere. Some conversations are confidential and hence chatbots have to verify authenticity of users. Sending an OTP via SMS is a popular way to identify a user. 

In this code pattern we will provide steps to build a chatbot application that authenticates users through an SMS one time passcode (OTP). For example, a customer holding an insurance policy can use chatbot to get more information about his/her insurance policy. We will demonstate the usage of Watson Assistant, Cloud Functions and Custom APIs to build this application.

When you have completed this code pattern, you will understand how to:

* Build conversational interfaces into any application, device, or channel.
* Run your application code without servers.
* Build APIs to authenticate users on your chatbot.
* Make external API calls through Watson Assistant.

## Flow

This flow seems crowded. Can we not have the registration part in architecture (we can have it in code and demo). Or we can cover 1/2/3/4 all in one bullet point. Let's discuss this. 

1. User registers for a policy on the portal.
2. User data is stored in the database and policy details are sent to user’s phone number in an SMS through Twilio Messaging API.
3. User interacts with chatbot and asks for confidential info related to the policy. The user is prompted to enter OTP by Watson Assistant.
4. The query is sent to Watson Assistant which in turn invokes Cloud function to make an API call to the user defined backend API for retrieving info.
5. The user’s phone number is searched in the database and OTP generated by backend API is sent to user through Twilio.
6. User enters the OTP, in the chat application to authenticate himself/herself.
7. Watson Assistant validates OTP by interacting with backend API.
8. If the OTP is valid, the user requested confidential info is fetched from the database.
8. Cloud function returns the confidential info to Watson Assistant.
10. Watson Assistant displays the user requested confidential info.
11. User can see the confidential info in the Web UI.

### 1. Clone the repo

Clone the `authenticate-users-on-your-chatbot-with-sms-otp` repo locally. In a terminal, run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/IBM/authenticate-users-on-your-chatbot-with-sms-otp.git
```


### 2. Create Twilio service

Twilio is a SaaS offering that provides APIs to make and receive calls or text messages. We will be using Twilio to send SMS to user programmatically from backend. Lets start by creating a free Twilio service.

- Create a free Twilio service here: <https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio>.

- Enter the your details on this page as prompted to signup.
    ![twilio-signup](doc/source/images/createTwilio.png)

- Once you create a Twilio service, you will have to verify your email id as well as your phone number.

- To verify your email id, visit your registered email id and you will see a mail from Twilio with a verification link, go ahead and verify.How about this - You will receive verification link in the email provided during Twilio signup. Go ahead and verify your email id.

    ![](doc/source/images/verifyTwilio.png)

- Once email id is verified you will be prompted to enter your phone number, submit that and you will get an OTP on your registered number, enter that back to verify.

    ![](doc/source/images/verifyMobileTwilio.png)

- On successful verification you should see a welcome greeting message, additionally you will see a question **Do you write code?**, select **Yes** to proceed.

    ![](doc/source/images/twilioWelcome.png)

- The second question asked to you would be **What is your preferred language?**, select **Python** to proceed.

    ![](doc/source/images/twilioWelcome2.png)

- Third question asked to you would be **What is your goal today?**, select **Use Twilio in a project** to proceed.

    ![](doc/source/images/twilioWelcome3.png)

- The final question asked to you would be **What do you want to do first?**, select **Skip to dashboard** to proceed.

    ![](doc/source/images/twilioWelcome4.png)

- You will need a Twilio `Trial Number` to send messages(OTP). Click on **Get a Trial Number** as shown.

    ![](doc/source/images/twilio-credentials-from-twilio-console.png)

- Click on **Choose this Number** to continue. 

    ![](doc/source/images/twilioNo.png)

- A confirmation will be displayed once the number is generated, click on **Done**.

    ![](doc/source/images/congrats.png)

- To establish connection between the APIs and Twilio we need to get the `trial_number`, `account_sid` and `auth_token` from Twilio. 

- Visit <https://www.twilio.com/console> and expand the **Project Info** tab. You will see the `TRIAL NUMBER`, `ACCOUNT SID` and `AUTH TOKEN`, copy it in some notepad as it will be used in [Step 3](#3-deploy-custom-apis-on-cloud).

    ![](doc/source/images/credentials-twilio.png)

- At this point, you should have the `TRIAL NUMBER`, `ACCOUNT SID` and `AUTH TOKEN` from Twilio service.

- Now lets deploy the custom APIs and configure twilio credentials.

### 3. Deploy Custom APIs on Cloud

- Before you proceed, make sure you have installed [IBM Cloud CLI](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cli?topic=cloud-cli-getting-started&locale=en-US) in your deployment machine.

- From the cloned repo, goto **custom-apis-for-authentication** directory in terminal, and run the following commands to deploy the Application to IBM Cloud Foundry.

    ```bash
    $ cd custom-apis-for-authentication/
    ```

* Log in to your IBM Cloud account, and select an API endpoint.
    ```bash
    $ ibmcloud login
    ```

    >NOTE: If you have a federated user ID, instead use the following command to log in with your single sign-on ID.

    ```bash
    $ ibmcloud login --sso
    ```

* Target a Cloud Foundry org and space:
    ```bash
    $ ibmcloud target --cf
    ```

* From within the _custom-apis-for-authentication_ directory push your app to IBM Cloud.
    ```bash
    $ ibmcloud cf push otp-api
    ```

- The [manifest.yml](custom-apis-for-authentication/manifest.yml) file will be used here to deploy the application to IBM Cloud Foundry.

- On Successful deployment of the application you will see something similar on your terminal as shown.

    <pre><code>Invoking 'cf push'...

    Pushing from manifest to org manoj.jahgirdar@in.ibm.com / space dev as manoj.jahgirdar@in.ibm.com...

    ...

    Waiting for app to start...

    </code></pre>

* Once the app is deployed you can visit the `routes` to launch the application.

>Example: http://otp-api.xx-xx.mybluemix.net

- At this point, you will have successfully deployed the framework on IBM Cloud. Now lets access it and see how it looks like.

- Visit the `URL` in your browser to access the framework.

    >Example: http://otp-api.xx-xx.mybluemix.net

    ![](doc/source/images/screenshot.png)

- Click on the **Add Twilio Credentials** button and enter the `TRIAL NUMBER`, `ACCOUNT SID` and `AUTH TOKEN` copied in [step 2](#2-create-twilio-service).

    ![](doc/source/images/add-twilio.png)

- Once the credentials are entered you will see the status as `Configured` as shown.

    ![](doc/source/images/twilio-conf.png)

- At this point you will have successfully deployed and configured the custom APIs.

### 4. Create a Cloud Function Action

Cloud Funtions is Functions-as-a-Service (FaaS) platform based on Apache OpenWhisk. As Watson Assistant can't interact with any external API, We will be using Cloud Function Actions to interact with our external database API and exchange data.

- Login to IBM Cloud, and [Create a cloud function action](https://cloud.ibm.com/functions/create/action).
* Enter a cloud function name and select Python 3.7 for runtime environment and press create.
![createCF](doc/source/images/createCF.png)

* You will see a hello world code in the canvas
![helloWorld](doc/source/images/helloWorld.png)

* Copy the code from [here](cloud-function-action/otp-auth.py) and replace it in the canvas as shown.
![cloudCode](doc/source/images/cloudCode.png)

* Replace the `APIENDPOINT` in the code with the URL that you copied to your notepad in [Step 5](#5-deploy-custom-apis-on-cloud).
>Example: APIENDPOINT = "http://158.123.197.53:32000"

* Click on **Endpoints** on the left panel and select **Enable as Web Action** finally click on **Save**.
![cfEnable](doc/source/images/cfEnable.png)

* Finally Copy the Public Link which is displayed.
![cfCopy](doc/source/images/cfCopy.png)
>NOTE: The Above URL should end with .json if it is not ending with .json please append .json at the end of the URL. 
**NOTE: This URL is Important, please save it in any notepad since it will be used in subsequent steps.**
