# Steps

1. [Clone the repo](#1-clone-the-repo).
2. [Create Watson services](#2-create-watson-services).
3. [Import the Watson Assistant workspace](#3-import-the-watson-assistant-workspace).
4. [Configure credentials](#4-configure-credentials).
5. [Run the application](#5-run-the-application).

### 1. Clone the repo

Clone the `watson-banking-chatbot` repo locally. In a terminal, run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/IBM/watson-banking-chatbot
```

Weâ€™ll be using the file [`data/assistant/workspaces/banking.json`](data/assistant/workspaces/banking.json) and the folder
[`data/assistant/workspaces/`](data/assistant/workspaces/)

### 2. Create Watson services

Create the following services:

* [**Watson Assistant**](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/assistant)
* [**Watson Discovery**](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/discovery)
* [**Watson Tone Analyzer**](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/tone-analyzer)
* [**Watson Natural Language Understanding**](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/natural-language-understanding)

### 3. Import the Watson Assistant workspace

* Find the Watson Assistant service in your IBM Cloud Dashboard.
* Select the service, and then click **Launch tool**.
* Go to the **Skills** tab.
* Click **Create skill**.
* Click the **Import skill** tab.
* Click **Choose JSON file**, go to your cloned repo dir, and `Open` the workspace.json file in `data/conversation/workspaces/banking.json` (or the old full version in `full_banking.json`).
* Select **Everything**, and click **Import**.

To find the `WORKSPACE_ID` for Watson Assistant:

* Go back to the **Skills** tab.
* Click the three dots in the upper-right corner of the **watson-banking-chatbot** card, and select **View API Details**.
* Copy the `Workspace ID` GUID.

*Optionally*, to view the assistant dialog, select the workspace and choose the
**Dialog** tab. Here's a snippet of the dialog:

### 4. Configure credentials


### 5. Run the application

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) runtime or NPM.
1. Start the app by running `npm install`, followed by `npm start`.
1. Use the chatbot at `localhost:3000`.

> Note: The server host can be changed as required in the server.js file, and `PORT` can be set in the `.env` file.
