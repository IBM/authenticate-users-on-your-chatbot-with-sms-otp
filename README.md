# Authenticate users on your chatbot with SMS one time passcode

Chatbots are prevalent everywhere. Some conversations are confidential and hence chatbots have to verify authenticity of users. Sending an OTP via SMS is a popular way to identify a user. 

In this code pattern we will provide steps to build a chatbot application that authenticates users through an SMS one time passcode (OTP). For example, a customer holding an insurance policy can use chatbot to get more information about his/her insurance policy. We will demonstrate the usage of Watson Assistant, Cloud Functions and Custom APIs to build this application.

When you have completed this code pattern, you will understand how to:

* Build conversational interfaces into any application, device, or channel.
* Run your application code without servers.
* Build APIs to authenticate users on your chatbot.
* Make external API calls through Watson Assistant.

## Flow


1. User registers for a policy on the portal.
2. User data is stored in the database and policy details are sent to user’s phone number in an SMS through Twilio Messaging API.
3. User interacts with chatbot and asks for confidential info related to the policy. The user is prompted to enter OTP by Watson Assistant.
4. The query is sent to Watson Assistant which in turn invokes Cloud function to make an API call to the user defined backend API for retrieving info.
5. The user’s phone number is searched in the database and OTP generated by backend API is sent to user through Twilio.
6. User enters the OTP, in the chat application to authenticate himself/herself.
7. Watson Assistant validates OTP by interacting with backend API.
8. If the OTP is valid, the user requested confidential info is fetched from the database.
8. Cloud function returns the confidential info to Watson Assistant.
10. Watson Assistant displays the user requested confidential info.
11. User can see the confidential info in the Web UI.

### 1. Clone the repo

Clone the `authenticate-users-on-your-chatbot-with-sms-otp` repo locally. In a terminal, run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/IBM/authenticate-users-on-your-chatbot-with-sms-otp.git
```


### 2. Setup Twilio messaging service

Twilio is a SaaS offering that provides APIs to make and receive calls or text messages. We will be using Twilio to send SMS to user programmatically from backend. Lets start by creating a free Twilio service.

---

#### 2.1 Create Twilio service

- Create a free Twilio service here: <https://www.twilio.com/try-twilio>.

>NOTE: - Once you create a Twilio service, you will have to verify your email id as well as your phone number.

>- You will receive verification link in the email provided during Twilio sign up. Go ahead and verify your email id.
![](doc/source/images/verifyTwilio.png)

- Once email id is verified you will be prompted to enter your phone number, submit that and you will get an OTP on your registered number, enter that back to verify.

    ![](doc/source/images/verifyMobileTwilio.png)

- On successful verification you should see a welcome greeting message, additionally you will see some questions, select as described below.

    ![](doc/source/images/twilio-details.png)

    Questions|Answers
    --|--
    Which Twilio product are you here to use?| SMS
    What do you plan to build with Twilio?| Alerts & Notifications
    How do you want to build with Twilio?| With code
    What is your preferred coding language?| Python
    Would you like Twilio to host your code?| No, I want to use my own hosting service

---
#### 2.2 Create Twilio Trial Number

- You will need a Twilio `Trial Number` to send messages(OTP). Click on **Get a Trial Number** as shown.

    ![](doc/source/images/twilio-credentials-from-twilio-console.png)

- Click on **Choose this Number** to continue. 

    ![](doc/source/images/twilioNo.png)

- A confirmation will be displayed once the number is generated, click on **Done**.

    ![](doc/source/images/congrats.png)
---
#### 2.3 Verified Caller IDs

- Twilio trial number doesn't send messages to your phone number if your phone number is not added to the `Verified Caller IDs` list. This is a limitation of a free trial number. Visit <https://www.twilio.com/console/phone-numbers/verified> and add your phone number to the verified caller ID list before you continue.
---
- To establish connection between the APIs and Twilio we need to get the `trial_number`, `account_sid` and `auth_token` from Twilio. 

- Visit <https://www.twilio.com/console> and expand the **Project Info** tab. You will see the `TRIAL NUMBER`, `ACCOUNT SID` and `AUTH TOKEN`, copy it in some notepad as it will be used in [Step 3](#3-deploy-custom-apis).
![](doc/source/images/credentials-twilio.png)

- At this point, you should have the `TRIAL NUMBER`, `ACCOUNT SID` and `AUTH TOKEN` from Twilio service.

- Now lets deploy the custom APIs and configure twilio credentials.

### 3. Deploy Custom APIs

In this code pattern, custom APIs are developed to perform various tasks such as:
- Store users data in a Database
- Search users phone number and send out an OTP
- Validate OTP and Authenticate users
- Query users data

Custom APIs are developed in Python Flask and you can deploy it in OpenShift or IBM Cloud Foundry.

<details><summary><b>Steps to Build and Deploy on OpenShift</b></summary>

<b>Note:</b> If you want to deploy the Custom APIs without any modifications, you can skip the **Build** steps and directly follow the **Deploy** steps. If you want to make some modifications in the APIs and then deploy it then follow the **Build** step.


#### Build
> Note: Make sure you have docker cli installed and logged in to DockerHub

- In cloned repo, navigate to `custom-apis-for-authentication/` directory and build the docker image. In terminal run:
```bash
$ docker build -t <your-docker-username>/otp-apis:v1 .
```
> Replace `<your-docker-username>` with your docker hub username

- Once the docker image is built, deploy the docker image to Dockerhub. In terminal run:
```bash
$ docker push <your-docker-username>/otp-apis:v1
```

- At this point you have built the container image and successfully pushed to to a container repository dockerhub. 

- Copy the image tag `<your-docker-username>/otp-apis:v1` and replace it on line no `18` in `deployment-scripts/api-deploy.yaml`

<pre><code>spec:
      containers:
      - name: otp-apis
        image:<b> < your-docker-username >/otp-apis:v1 </b>
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
</code></pre>


#### Deploy

- Login to your OpenShift cluster, In terminal run:
```bash
$ oc login -u <username> -p <password>
```

- Alternatively you can also login with an auth token. Follow the [Step here](https://developer.ibm.com/tutorials/configure-a-red-hat-openshift-cluster-with-red-hat-marketplace/#4-connect-to-the-openshift-cluster-in-your-cli) to login through an auth token.

- Once you have logged into OpenShift from your terminal, you can run the `oc apply` command to deploy the Application on OpenShift. In cloned repo, navigate to `deployment-scripts/` directory and in terminal run:
```bash
$ cd deployment-scripts/
$ oc apply -f api-deploy.yaml
```

```
deployment.apps/otp-apis created
service/otp-apis-service created
route.route.openshift.io/otp-apis-url created
```

- A deployment, service and a route will be created. To access the App, In terminal run:
```bash
$ oc get route -n default
```

```
NAME           HOST/PORT                                                                                                           PATH   SERVICES           PORT   TERMINATION   WILDCARD
otp-apis-url   otp-apis-url-default.xxx.us-south.containers.appdomain.cloud   /      otp-apis-service   8080                 None
```

- You will see the `PATH` for with service name `otp-apis-url`.
- Make a note of this url, as `APIEndPoint` to be used in step 4.

>Example: http://otp-apis-url-default.xxx.us-south.containers.appdomain.cloud

- At this point, you will have successfully deployed the Custom APIs on OpenShift. Now lets access it and see how it looks like.

</details>

<details><summary><b>Steps to Build and Deploy on IBM Public Cloud Foundry</b></summary>

#### Build and Deploy

- Before you proceed, make sure you have installed [IBM Cloud CLI](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cli?topic=cloud-cli-getting-started&locale=en-US) in your deployment machine.

- From the cloned repo, goto **custom-apis-for-authentication** directory in terminal, and run the following commands to deploy the Application to IBM Cloud Foundry.

    ```bash
    $ cd custom-apis-for-authentication/
    ```

* Log in to your IBM Cloud account, and select an API endpoint.
    ```bash
    $ ibmcloud login
    ```

    >NOTE: If you have a federated user ID, instead use the following command to log in with your single sign-on ID.

    ```bash
    $ ibmcloud login --sso
    ```

* Target a Cloud Foundry org and space:
    ```bash
    $ ibmcloud target --cf
    ```

* From within the _custom-apis-for-authentication_ directory push your app to IBM Cloud.
    ```bash
    $ ibmcloud cf push otp-api
    ```

- The [manifest.yml](custom-apis-for-authentication/manifest.yml) file will be used here to deploy the application to IBM Cloud Foundry.

- On Successful deployment of the application you will see something similar on your terminal as shown.
<pre><code>
Invoking 'cf push'...
Shown below is a sample output

</code></pre>

* Once the app is deployed, from the output of the above command, you can visit the `routes` to launch the application.

* Make a note of this url, as `APIENDPOINT` to be used in [step 4](#4-create-a-cloud-function-action).

>Example: http://otp-api.xx-xx.mybluemix.net if deployed on IBM Cloud Foundry, http://otp-apis-url-default.xxx.us-south.containers.appdomain.cloud if deployed on OpenShift

>Note: Add `http://` to the OpenShift url if not present.

- At this point, you will have successfully deployed the Custom APIs on IBM Cloud. Now lets access it and see how it looks like.

</details>

Once you have deployed the Custom APIs, continue with the documentation:

- Visit the `URL` in your browser to access the framework.

    ![](doc/source/images/screenshot.png)

- Click on the **Add Twilio Credentials** button and enter the `TRIAL NUMBER`, `ACCOUNT SID` and `AUTH TOKEN` copied in [Step 2](#2-create-twilio-service). and click Submit

    ![](doc/source/images/add-twilio.png)

- Once the credentials are entered you will see the status as `Configured` as shown.

    ![](doc/source/images/twilio-conf.png)

- At this point you will have successfully deployed and configured the custom APIs.

### 4. Create a Cloud Function Action

IBM Cloud Function is a Serverless Architecture where in a user can write a snippet of code and run it as API's without worrying about deploying it. Through webhook we will be using Cloud Function Actions to interact with our external database API and exchange data.

- Login to IBM Cloud, and [Create a cloud function action](https://cloud.ibm.com/functions/create/action).
- Click "Start Creating " button. Select "Action".
* Enter a cloud function name and select Python 3.7 for runtime environment and click `create`.

* You will see a hello world code in the canvas
![helloWorld](doc/source/images/helloWorld.png)

* Copy the code from [cloud-function-action/otp-auth.py](cloud-function-action/otp-auth.py) and replace it in the canvas as shown. 
![cloudCode](doc/source/images/cloudCode.png)

* This code acts as an intermediater between Watson Assistant and the Custom APIs. Any API calls requested by Watson Assistant will go through this Cloud Function code, and response will be returned back to Watson Assistant.

* Replace the `APIENDPOINT` in the code with the URL that you copied to your notepad in [Step 3](#3-deploy-custom-apis).

>Example: http://otp-api.xx-xx.mybluemix.net if deployed on IBM Cloud Foundry, http://otp-apis-url-default.xxx.us-south.containers.appdomain.cloud if deployed on OpenShift

* Click on **Endpoints** on the left panel and select **Enable as Web Action**. Click on **Save**.
